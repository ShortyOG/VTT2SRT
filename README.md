# VTT2SRT
Utility to convert subtitle files from Vimeo format (.vtt) to Subrip format (.srt). Can handle a large number of files at once by dumping all the target .vtt files in a directory, then targeting this directory with the dialog window that appears.

"This tool was created to help with conversions of subtitles from Vimeo format (.vtt) to SubRip format (.srt) files. This tool is capable of converting a even a large amount of files instantly. Use of this tool is simple and doesn't change depending on the number of files needing to be converted.

To begin, create a folder in an accessible location where you can place all of the Vimeo format (.vtt) files needing to be converted. Once all files have been placed directly inside of this folder, go ahead and launch the "VTT2SRT.exe" file. A command prompt window will pop up in the background, however you can safely ignore this. A file explorer window will appear and ask you to select a folder. You will target the folder that you previously placed the .vtt files in and press the "Select Folder" button.

Doing this will create a version of the file in SubRip format with the same base name as the file it was converted from (for example test1.vtt would create a file called test1.srt)."
